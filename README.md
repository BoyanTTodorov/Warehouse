# Warehouse Data Generator

This project leverages Python along with the Faker library to generate synthetic data designed for a warehouse management system. The objective is to streamline the analysis process in POWER BI by storing the artificially generated data in a Sqlite serverless database. Please be aware that to ensure compatibility with POWER BI, it is necessary to install a new driver.
