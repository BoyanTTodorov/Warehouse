# Warehouse Data Generator

This project utilizes Python and the Faker library to create synthetic data for a warehouse management system. The intention is to facilitate analysis in POWER BI by storing the generated data in a Sqlite serverless database. However, it's important to note that for compatibility with POWER BI, a new driver must be installed.
